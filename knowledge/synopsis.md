Introduction Saga

Saitama Introduction Arc

Saitama vs. Vaccine Man.
Saitama watches a news report on Vaccine Man attacking Z-City. Seeing the destruction, Saitama decides to confront the monster.[13]

Saitama appears at the scene just in time to save a young girl from Vaccine Man. The monster asks who Saitama is. Saitama replies that he is "just a guy who's a hero for fun". After reluctantly listening to the monster's angry monologue and watching its transformation, Saitama kills it with a single punch. After this, he screams out in frustration at another easy victory.[14]

Saitama vs. Marugori.
Sometime after, Saitama hears about a Demon-level disaster emergency stemming from the destruction of D-City by the The Brain and Brawn Brothers. Saitama appears on the monstrous Marugori's shoulder and tells him to put some pants on. Fukegao, Marugori's brother, who is on his other shoulder, orders his brother to swat Saitama. However, Marugori absentmindedly swats the wrong shoulder, instantly killing his brother. Enraged, Marugori grabs Saitama, throws him to the ground, and assaults him with a flurry of punches, leaving a large hole in the ground. Saitama jumps out of the hole and punches Marugori to the ground with a single punch. As Marugori topples over, Saitama states that having an overwhelming power is boring. Unfortunately, Saitama's blow causes Marugori to fall on top of B-City and destroy it.[15]

On his way home, Saitama encounters Super Custom YO649Z Mk. II. The monster rants about his backstory and Saitama kills it with one punch.[16]

House of Evolution Arc

.
Saitama vs. Mosquito.
While Saitama laments his emotionless life, a mosquito land on his hand. After unsuccessfully swatting at it, it flies off and leaves Saitama enraged. Saitama then sees a news report about a mosquito swarm headed toward his city.[18]

Saitama meets Genos.
Saitama pursues the mosquito he had been trying to kill and encounters Genos fighting Mosquito Girl. At that moment, Mosquito Girl finishes her blood-fueled evolution and sends her mosquitoes crashing down on Saitama and Genos. Genos incinerates the swarm, unintentionally burning Saitama's clothes off in the process.[19]

Saitama slaps Mosquito Girl.
The newly empowered Mosquito Girl starts attacking Genos and tearing him apart with her claws. Just as Genos is about to resort to self-destructing, Saitama slaps Mosquito Girl, sending her flying through a nearby building and into the sky. Dusting off his hands, Saitama states that he hates mosquitoes. After witnessing Saitama's incredible power, Genos asks Saitama to make him his apprentice.[20]

At Saitama's apartment, Genos gives a long explanation of his past and motives, but Saitama is completely uninterested.[21] Nevertheless, Saitama agrees to take Genos in when Genos explains that he simply wants to become as strong as Saitama.[22]

Saitama kills Kamakyuri.
Meanwhile, Dr. Genus of the House of Evolution sends his creations to retrieve Saitama as a test subject after seeing him defeat Mosquito Girl.[23] Kamakyuri arrives at Saitama's apartment first, crashing through the ceiling, but Saitama punches his head off. Saitama jumps outside and buries Frog Man and Slugerous in the ground. Ground Dragon grabs Saitama's legs and pulls his body into the ground, leaving only his head above the ground. Genos rushes Saitama's aid, but is intercepted by Armored Gorilla.[24] Beast King then approaches Saitama.[25]

Saitama cuts off Ground Dragon's retreat.
Saitama starts to doze off, which angers Beast King. The creature threatens Saitama, who effortlessly steps out of the ground, much to the surprise of Ground Dragon. Beast King then attacks Saitama, killing Frog Man and Slugerous in the process, but Saitama dodges his attacks. Saitama uses Consecutive Normal Punches and obliterates the monster. The terrified Ground Dragon tries to flee underground, but Saitama digs underground and punches the monster out. When Saitama gets back to the surface, he finds that Genos has defeated Armored Gorilla, and is interrogating him. After Saitama shows Armored Gorilla the remains of Beast King, Armored Gorilla tells them all they want to know.[26][27]

Saitama arrives at the House of Evolution.
Roughly four hours later, Saitama and Genos climb a forest path and arrive at the House of Evolution headquarters. Wasting no time, Genos destroys the above-ground portion of the base with an energy blast, surprising Saitama slightly with his ruthlessness. In the rubble, they find a metal door which leads to the underground facility.[28] As they enter the subterranean portion of the lair, they hear Carnage Kabuto bounding down the corridor. The monster slams Genos into the wall and challenges Saitama to a fight. Saitama accepts the challenge.[29]

As the two are about to fight, Genos re-appears and attempts to fight Carnage Kabuto, but is beaten down again. Carnage Kabuto comments on how he can feel that Saitama is really strong, while Saitama tells him not to disappoint him, as he expects Carnage Kabuto to be the strongest being of the House of Evolution.[30]

Saitama intimidating Carnage Kabuto.
Moving with tremendous speed, Carnage Kabuto moves behind Saitama. Just as he is about to strike, he leaps backward. He senses that if he had attacked Saitama at that moment, he would have been killed. He explodes with rage and fear, and asks Saitama how he got so strong.[31] Saitama agrees to tell everybody around him and explains that he got his strength by training his body. His regimen consisted of 100 sit-ups, 100 push-ups, 100 squats, and a ten-kilometer run every single day. Genos is outraged, stating that Saitama's strength would be totally impossible to achieve with that level of routine strength training.[32]

Saitama defeats Carnage Kabuto.
Annoyed by Saitama's apparent lie, Carnage Kabuto enters Carnage Mode and states that he will rampage for a week until the next Saturday. Carnage Kabuto then begins to pummel Saitama, sending him flying around the room. While this is going on, Saitama comes to the horrifying realization that if Carnage Mode lasts for a whole week ending on a Saturday, then the current day is Saturday and he missed the special sale. Overcome with despair, he cries out and obliterates Carnage Kabuto with one punch.[33][34] Genos informs him that they still have some time if they hurry to the sale.

Paradise Group Arc

Saitama getting ready to hunt down the Paradisers.
Saitama is first seen waking up frantically from a dream involving someone pointing a snotty finger at him. Realizing it was just a dream, he turns on the news and finds out that the criminal Hammerhead and his terrorist organization known as the Paradisers, consisting entirely of bald, dangerous-looking men have arrived and started wreaking havoc. The news warns everyone to avoid any bald men with a dangerous aura. This angers Saitama who states that this group will ruin his image, as everyone will mistake him for a villain. He resolves to destroy the Paradisers to protect his image.[35] Saitama heads out to search for the villains, and on his way, many people end up mistaking him for a member of the Paradisers.[36]

Saitama destroys Hammerhead's battle suit.
On his search for the Paradisers, Saitama finds himself lost in a forest. Trying to find a path out, he is halted by Hammerhead. Hammerhead mistakes Saitama for someone wanting to join up with the Paradisers, but Saitama tells him that he actually came to destroy them. Hammerhead swiftly attacks Saitama with a vicious punch, but Saitama is unfazed and unimpressed. Enraged, Hammerhead charges up to full power and executes his Windmill Attack. Upon seeing this, Saitama notices it looks much like an "attack" he used to perform as a kid and wonders if Hammerhead is similar to him. He then stops the attack with little effort and shatters Hammerhead's battle suit with a normal elbow. After making him promise to never do bad things again, Saitama allows Hammerhead to flee.[37]

Saitama stopping Speed-o'-Sound Sonic's attack.
Shortly after, a powerful ninja, Speed-o'-Sound Sonic, arrives demanding to know where Hammerhead has gone. Saitama points in the direction that Hammerhead fled in. Sonic then attacks Saitama, mistaking him for a member of the Paradisers, with a kunai thrown at lightning-fast speed. However, Saitama effortlessly catches both the kunai and Sonic's subsequent attack with a sword and then proceeds to break the sword in half. Saitama then frantically explains that he is not a member of the Paradisers, and asks Sonic whether or not he recognizes him as the man who has saved the world many times. When Sonic denies knowing him, Saitama becomes severely disheartened. Sonic again proceeds to attack Saitama, stating that the real problem is that Saitama was able to see two of Sonic's attacks, and that his pride cannot allow for Saitama to live. Upon hearing this, Saitama accuses Sonic of being a liar, stating that Sonic just wants to test his attacks on him, indicated by the "childlike smile" on Sonic's face.[38]

Saitama ends the fight.
After Sonic jumps around for quite some time, Saitama intercepts him by looking at him and asks if he can go home now. Surprised, Sonic retaliates with a Wind Blade Kick. Saitama attempts to interrupt Sonic's attack by placing his fist directly in the path of Sonic's groin. However, he accidentally moves his fist too far and taps Sonic's groin. Clearly in pain, Sonic swears that he will train day and night for their rematch as Saitama encourages him and Sonic flees.[39]

Saitama in shock.
Later, Saitama is at his apartment going over the day's events with Genos. Saitama asks Genos to leave, stating that he is in shock due to a certain event that occurred that day. Genos, worried about anything that might shock Saitama, asks what it was, and Saitama explains that he cannot believe that Sonic had no idea who he was despite all of his previous exploits. Genos then asks if Saitama was a registered superhero, to which Saitama replies that he is not. Genos goes on to explain that anyone who hasn't registered with the Hero Association will never be recognized for their feats. Saitama resolves to become a licensed hero so he can achieve the fame he deserves. He asks Genos to register with him in exchange for formally accepting the latter as his disciple.[40][41]

Hero Association Saga

National Superhero Registry Arc

Saitama dominates the exam.
Saitama dominates the exam.
Saitama arrives at the 6th Official Superhero Certification Exam Center, and begins a series of physical tests. Saitama does so well on the physical tests that he awes the examiners and disheartens the up and coming heroes from taking the tests altogether.

Later, in the waiting room, Saitama meets with Genos, and the two discuss the easiness of the hero qualification tests, and state that there is no way they didn't pass. When the results of the tests arrive, it is revealed that Saitama barely passed, having achieved a score of 71 when the passing is 70; and received the C-Class hero designation. Despite this, Saitama achieved a perfect score in every physical test and broke every record of the Hero Association, and the only reason his score was so low was that he did poorly on the written test.[42]

Later, during a lecture from an A-Class hero Sneck, Saitama is chewing bubble gum, seemingly bored. This angers Sneck[43] and, along with hearing the news that Saitama could quickly surpass him, causes Sneck to ambush Saitama. However, he is quickly defeated.[44]

Saitama's Death Punch
1/2
Sometime later, Genos requests a sparring match with Saitama. Saitama, having earlier agreed to take Genos as his disciple officially, under the condition that Genos registers as a hero as well, accepts his challenge. The battle begins with Genos firing a massive energy attack which Saitama dodges with ease. Genos proceeds to attack Saitama physically, but eventually discovers he was chasing Saitama's afterimage the whole time.[45] After an extremely close-range energy attack in which Genos believes he finally landed a blow on Saitama, Saitama, having dodged the attack, pokes Genos' face and declares himself the victor. Genos stops to reminds him that the match cannot end until one of them is unable to continue. Upon hearing this, Saitama appears in front of Genos, and delivers a Death Punch, which stops inches before hitting Genos' face. Though unharmed, the landscape behind Genos is obliterated. Saitama and Genos then return home.[46]

After the sparring match, they head out to a shop, where they had an eating contest. While Genos had no problem eating, Saitama nearly passed out. The A-Class hero Sweet Mask comes, and asks Genos to speak with him outside, with Saitama warning Genos about rookie crushing.[47]

Saitama worried.
Five days later, Saitama is seen lounging around his house reading a magazine. He notices Genos, carrying a huge backpack full of contents unknown, who then requests to live with him. At first he declines, but after Genos tells him that he will pay him the rent, Saitama allows Genos to stay with him.[48][47]

Genos later informs Saitama that all C-Class heroes who are inactive for a week are removed from the official registry. Saitama, realizing he only has two days remaining, sets out to find a villain, only to discover that Z-City is completely peaceful. Saitama decides that he will check again the next day and returns home. Upon discovering that Z-City is peaceful for the second day in a row, he becomes greatly distressed. All of a sudden, a kunai is thrown at Saitama. Saitama catches it, and discovers that his would-be assailant is Speed-o'-Sound Sonic.[49]

Saitama being belittled by Tanktop Tiger.
Saitama tells Sonic that he is busy, and begins to walk away, but Sonic rushes to intercept him. Frustrated, Saitama bites Sonic's sword, shattering it in the blink of an eye. Saitama then threatens Sonic, that if he gets in his way again, he will punch him. At this moment a woman from the crowd observes Saitama and states that he is a 'suspicious person'. Saitama, thinking that the woman was referring to Sonic, begins to lecture Sonic for being so violent. Then, a C-Class hero, named Tanktop Tiger, explains that the woman was referring to him. Saitama says that he is also a registered hero, but Tanktop Tiger states that he has no idea who Saitama is, and thinks that he should leave as he is ruining the reputation of other heroes. Saitama becomes increasingly annoyed, but before he has a chance to attack, Sonic launches a surprise assault on Tanktop Tiger, who is defeated instantly.[50]

Saitama defeating Sonic.
Sonic begins to wreak havoc on the surrounding civilians. During this chaos, Saitama saves a small boy's life by effortlessly moving a tree in place to intercept a falling car that would have killed the boy. Saitama, angered both by the fact that he can't find a bad guy to fight, and that civilians are in danger, realizes that Sonic is now considered a bad guy and decides to retaliate. Saitama appears behind Sonic and dispatches him with a single swift chop. By defeating Sonic, he has saved himself from being removed as a registered hero.[51]

Rumored Monster Arc

Saitama with some Kombu.
Saitama, apparently returning home from shopping, happens upon a scene where Kombu Infinity had just defeated two A-Class heroes in battle. Upon seeing the monster, Saitama remembers that he forgot to get kombu and notices that the monster appears to be made of it.[52] Later that day, Saitama is seen cooking kombu that was taken directly from the monster's body, leaving it totally naked. Genos states that Saitama wanted to eat kombu to see if it could make his hair grow back. Saitama, however, is frustrated with Genos, saying that he himself has never mentioned anything about hair.[53][54]

Giant Meteor Arc

Saitama asks Bang to watch over Genos.
Saitama and Genos are relaxing in their apartment when Genos tells Saitama that he's been promoted from C-Class rank 388 to rank 342, and while he hasn't been raised from S-Class rank 17, he's been ranked 6th in popularity.[55] Genos then gets a call from the Hero Association and heads out.[56]

Later, after Genos fails to destroy the meteor heading towards the Earth, Saitama shows up and asks Bang to take care of Genos. He then launches himself at the meteor and punches his way through it, causing it to break apart. Unfortunately, the pieces of the meteor then rain down on Z-City. Saitama lands, and then walks off, concluding that the situation is taken care of.[57]

Saitama destroys the meteor.
Three days later, Saitama and Genos are relaxing in their apartment, watching a news report on how the meteor fragments destroyed many buildings and businesses in the city. After learning that his rank had jumped up from C-Class rank 342 to rank 5, Saitama gets excited and decides to go out for a walk around town. During his walk, he gets called out by Tanktop Tiger, but Saitama doesn't remember who he is. Tanktop Tiger then declares that Saitama is a liar; that there is no way he would be able to destroy a meteor on his own, and that he merely took credit of the S-Class heroes' work. Saitama starts to defend himself but is cut-off by Tanktop Tiger who calls out for his big brother, who jumps in and introduces himself as Tanktop Black Hole.[58]

Saitama attacked by Tanktop Black Hole.
Tanktop Black Hole claims that he has a perfect punishment for a "lying cheater" like Saitama. He then, in a rather loud voice, starts accusing Saitama of destroying the town. The commotion starts to attract citizens who begin to gather around the scene. Tanktop Black Hole continues to accuse Saitama of destroying the town on purpose and slowly, the crowd begins to turn on Saitama, shouting out threats and accusations along with Tanktop Black Hole. Tanktop Black Hole then accuses Saitama of wanting to destroy the citizens, just as he "destroyed" the town, and then challenges him to a fight. Tanktop Tiger then rushes forward to attack Saitama, but gets easily knocked away into a pile of rubble, much to Tanktop Black Hole's surprise. Tanktop Black Hole then jumps in and tries to crush Saitama with his grip. Saitama intercepts him and locks hands with Tanktop Black Hole and squeezes, causing him to fall to his knees in pain, and apologize for lying. To his surprise, however, Saitama tells him that he wasn't lying.

Saitama telling everyone he destroyed the meteor.
Saitama then shouts to all the citizens that he did destroy the meteor and that if anyone has a problem with him they should say it to his face. Some citizens move to accuse him of damage done to their property, but Saitama quickly shouts them down, telling them to blame it on the meteor, and that he's not doing hero work because he wants to be admired by them, but because it is something he wants to do, leaving his accusers stunned in silence.[59][60]

Sea Monster Arc

Saitama about to fight a Seafolk.
Saitama about to fight a Seafolk.
On his way home, Saitama comes across a Seafolk about to attack a city, so he defeats it quickly.[61] Sometime later, Saitama is relaxing as Genos does dishes and explains that Saitama has advanced to the second rank of C-Class. He goes on to explain that once Saitama becomes rank 1, he can get promoted to B-Class. Genos then starts talking about how the top-ranking C-Class hero hasn't left his position for around half a year, which apparently is no match for the top-ranking B-Class hero. Before Genos can finish talking though, he gets a call about an attack on J-City by more Seafolk. After seeing a news report on the incident, they decide to head out to help.[62]

Saitama readying to face the Deep Sea King.
Saitama readying to face the Deep Sea King.
Sometime between them leaving, and them getting there, Saitama and Genos get separated. During his search for the Deep Sea King, Saitama finds Mumen Rider's cell phone lying in the street. Upon picking it up, the man on the other end of the line requests to know who he is speaking to and, despite Saitama only being listed as a C-Class hero, decides to disclose the location of the Deep Sea King, apparently to finally determine just how strong Saitama is.[63]

Later, Saitama arrives at the shelter just in time to witness Mumen Rider's defeat at the hands of the Deep Sea King. He catches Mumen Rider's unconscious body, and tells him he fought well. Saitama then observes the scene, and is surprised to find that Genos is still alive despite his grievous injuries. After remarking that he will quickly dispatch the Deep Sea King, Saitama is attacked by the monster. However, he is unscathed by its attack.[64]

Saitama unfazed by a punch from Deep Sea King.
Saitama unfazed by a punch from Deep Sea King.
Deep Sea King declares his surprise that Saitama did not fall from his punch, but Saitama remarks that the monster's punch was simply too weak to hurt him. Meanwhile, the spectators talk among themselves, telling each other that their situation has not changed at all with only a C-Class rank 2 hero arriving. Deep Sea King starts to tell Saitama that he, as the ruler of mother sea, stands at the very top of the pyramid of all living organisms on Earth. Saitama interrupts Deep Sea King and tells him to hurry up and fight. Deep Sea King then quickly attempts to punch Saitama, only for Saitama to outpace and punch a hole in his body, ending the monster's live.[65]

Saitama punches a hole through Deep Sea King's body.
Standing triumphantly over the body of the monster, Saitama overhears the crowd of onlookers, starting to question the usefulness of the rest of the heroes who battled the monster. Not wanting the heroes' good reputation to be tarnished, Saitama remarks loudly that he got off lucky, and that, if the other heroes hadn't weakened Deep Sea King beforehand, he wouldn't have stood a chance. To further the credibility of his ploy, Saitama plays on the rumors of his underhanded nature by stating that, because he is the one who dealt the finishing blow, he'll get all of the credit for the victory, regardless of the other heroes' valiant efforts. Saitama's plan proves successful, and the people's faith in the other heroes is restored. Saitama, on the other hand, grows more hated in the eyes of the citizens. Internally, Saitama reflects on how dull the battle with Deep Sea King turned out to be.

Saitama receiving hate mail.
Saitama receiving hate mail.
Sometime after the battle with Deep Sea King, Saitama and Genos receive a box via airdrop from the Hero Association, containing several letters addressed to the heroes themselves. Upon opening the five letters that were addressed to him, Saitama discovers that the first three contain nothing but hateful words accusing him of cowardice and cheating, which angered Genos greatly, but were disregarded by Saitama. The fourth letter contained a simple thank you message from an anonymous sender. The fifth letter turned out to be a letter directly from the Hero Association itself, notifying Saitama of his promotion to C-Class rank 1, and inviting him to the Hero Association Headquarters in Z-City.[66]

Saitama gets promoted to B-Class.
Saitama gets promoted to B-Class.
Upon arrival, Saitama requests to know why he was summoned to the headquarters and suspects that they called him there to reprimand him for his actions. His hosts, however, insist that the circumstances for which he was invited are quite the contrary and they congratulate him on reaching C-Class rank 1. They then go on to inquire as to whether or not Saitama will move up to B-Class or remain in C-Class. Saitama expresses his apathy on the subject but then goes on to state that he'd rather be B-Class, since he would no longer have to report his weekly activities to the Hero Association. He also internally reflects that he can't remain in C-Class forever, especially considering that Genos is already in S-Class.

Saitama with Mumen Rider.
Saitama with Mumen Rider.
Later on, Saitama is walking home, examining the official document declaring him a B-Class hero, when a delightful smell from a small oden shop draws him inside. Upon entering, Saitama orders an assorted oden and takes a seat at the counter where he is asked by another patron in the shop if he will have anything to drink with his oden. The patron then states that, if Saitama won't order a drink, then he will treat him to one. Upon observing this stranger, Saitama discovers it is none other than a bruised and battered Mumen Rider. Saitama questions why Mumen Rider would want to buy him a drink, to which Mumen Rider states that, if for nothing else, it would be to celebrate Saitama's promotion to B-Class and also reveals himself to be the sender of the "Thank You" letter that Saitama had received. Upon finally recognizing the man as Mumen Rider, who he saved from Deep Sea King, Saitama accepts his offer, and orders a mozuku.[67]

Some time afterward, Saitama would rank up from B-Class rank 101 to rank 63.

Alien Conquerors Arc

A staff reports a meeting for all S-Class heroes.
Saitama and Genos are watching the martial artist hero, Bang, demonstrate one of his techniques to the duo. Upon being asked to attempt the technique, the pair express their disinterest in a non-destructive technique, eliciting an outburst from Bang's only disciple Charanko. After being questioned on the whereabouts of the rest of his students, Bang explains that a long time ago one of his students went out of control and defeated a good handful of them, causing all of them to leave the dojo; subsequently forcing Bang to take it upon himself to take him down. Shortly after, a member of the Hero Association arrives and declares that all S-Class heroes are to report to HQ immediately to address a major crisis. Genos states that, since all S-Class are being convened, they might need Saitama's power, so Saitama accompanies them to HQ.[68]

Saitama meets Tatsumaki.
Saitama meets Tatsumaki.
The first S-Class hero to interact with Saitama is S-Class rank 4 Atomic Samurai, who even after hearing the praise of Saitama from Bang, refuses to shake Saitama's hand; stating that he will only acknowledge those in the S-Class. Saitama then hears a flurry of disapproving remarks at his presence at the meeting and looks over to discover the culprit is a very small girl who, to his surprise, happens to be the S-Class rank 2 Tatsumaki. Thinking she's just some cheeky kid, Saitama blatantly ignores her, and goes to sit down with the rest of the heroes, angering Tatsumaki, who continues to complain.[69] As most of the S-Class heroes are conspiring with their own thoughts, Bang asks what they were called here for. Saitama then casually asks for some tea.[70]

Saitama talking with Puri-Puri Prisoner.
After having heard of the great calamity foretold by the renowned fortuneteller Shibabawa, Sitch unnervingly elaborates on how punishing the impact of the most recent prediction she had made before her death would be. He tells the assembled heroes that the prediction may come true at any time in the next half a year. Saitama could not help but simply muse that this disaster that has the Hero Association coordinator so on edge could just as well occur today or tomorrow for that matter. After Sitch asked him who he was, Saitama simply states how glad he is to have come along for the meeting.[71]

Saitama observing the giant spaceship.

Just as he was finished bemusing over the emergency meeting, the entire building complex shook with thunderous turbulence as though it had been hit by a massive tremor, while outside the complex numerous flying creatures led by the Sky King could be seen gathering around for an all-out assault on the surface world.[72] However, the would-be incursion was soon dispatched by a UFO-like albatross the size of a major metropolitan area. Having already picked up on what had happened to the obliterated A-City outside the Hero Association's HQ, Saitama quickly leaps all the way to the rooftop to get a better view of the action before Genos could even erect a response out of him.

Saitama infiltrates the spaceship.
Saitama infiltrates the spaceship.
Upon seeing the giant spaceship, Saitama heads towards it, evading and deflecting cannon fire directed at him.[73] As soon as he managed to reach it, Groribas gets in his way, but is defeated in a single punch. Saitama keeps searching inside while wrecking whatever and whoever got in his way. Geryuganshoop tries to beg him into leaving the spaceship to no avail. Saitama eventually reaches Boros' throne room entrance, the leader of the invading Dark Matter Thieves. Before Saitama can reach Boros, however, Geryuganshoop challenges him, only to be easily dispatched; Saitama stating that flinging rocks around using telekinesis was a waste of superpowers before flinging one through Geryuganshoop's head. Boros is amazed that he managed to defeat his strongest fighters easily and proceeds to take him on.[74]

Saitama breaks into Boros's throne room.
Saitama breaks into Boros's throne room.
As the battle of the S-Class heroes and alien invaders began, Saitama's own battle with Boros is getting underway. After hearing why the aforementioned galactic warlord went on a tirade, shattering planets and razing civilizations, all due to insurmountable boredom out of being an unstoppable force looking for a worthy opponent to temper his might, Saitama expresses his disgust towards Boros' petty genocidal indulgence and whacks him. Doing so, however, inadvertently shatters his armor which acts as a restraining bolt on the intergalactic raiders own power. This somewhat surprises Saitama as this new opponent was one of the first individuals he has ever met to survive his one-hit-kill blow. Soon metamorphically shifting into a more powerfully energized form, Boros begins releasing his unsealed inner power.[75] As the two clash repeatedly, Boros compliments Saitama on having lasted this long against his might while the latter retorts that his adversary is equally impressive.

As the battle grows more and more intense, Boros begins taking the upper hand in the conflict against Saitama, knocking him around his vessel's throne room, eventually culminating in the two plowing through to the top of the ship. There, Saitama weathered some of Boros' strongest attacks, while only taking minimal damage in his assault. After having grown bored with Boros' constant boasting and flaunting of his regenerative capabilities, Saitama wonders aloud if he was finished due to his inability to fight seriously. Boros responds by unleashing his most powerful transformation yet, his "Meteoric Burst". Boros then unleashes a thunderous onslaught which began annihilating his own ship, subsequently kicking Saitama all the way to the moon. Saitama quickly realizes where he landed, catapulting himself from the moon's weaker orbit back to earth, landing meteorically upon his adversary's ship, causing it to jolt towards the ground upon upheaval due to the impact. Boros, now infuriated, furiously assaults Saitama, but Saitama simply counters with a devastating blow of his own, a simple punch that promptly eviscerated Boros, only for him to quickly regenerate his scattered self back together.

Saitama is kneed to the moon.
Saitama is kneed to the moon.
Initiating his final measure, the dreaded Boros struck out at his worthy opponent with his planet-killing trump card Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, intending to decimate Saitama and the earth's surface layer in one gigantic blast. However, Saitama, unfazed by this apocalyptic announcement, simply says he would counter with his own winning trump card; his Serious Series: Serious Punch, which not only deflected the genocide wave which obliterated Boros on the spot, but also parted the cloud cover for several thousand miles across the globe. While he lay dying, admitting he found the excitement he long sought after while making his way across the cosmos, Boros commented that he and Saitama fought to the bitter end with neither giving an inch with Saitama nodding in compliance. Boros says he knew full well that Saitama was still holding back the entire time they fought, disparaging at how powerful his better truly was with his last breaths, leaving Saitama to solemnly walk away from his fallen enemy in the collapsing fortress.

After finally making his way out of the ruined spaceship, Saitama meets with many other S-Class heroes such as Superalloy Darkshine, Tatsumaki and Atomic Samurai. After being asked how and why he was on the enemy ship, Genos comes rushing to the scene, concerned for his well being. After a brief conversation over who Saitama was fighting against, and how prophecies could have come to pass without his help, which Saitama writes off as untrue, Tatsumaki bursts into a fit of anger, interrupting them both. She denounces Saitama for what she perceives as interference in her battle, calling him names. With some coaxing from Saitama, Genos steps up and tells Tatsumaki off, seconds before being telekinetically thrown into some debris by her in outrage of being called a brat, only to be stopped seconds away from attacking Saitama by Bang, who admonishes her for her callous behavior as an S-Class hero.[76]

After the invasion, Saitama later destroys Pluton with one punch and angrily yells in frustration at his own overwhelming strength.[77]

King Arc

Saitama shopping with Genos.
Saitama shopping with Genos.
Saitama and Genos are in M-City, where they detect King's presence thanks to Genos. Genos wonders why King is there. While they talked, a sudden commotion occurred, where the source is the robot G4, whose primary goal is to eliminate King in the name of The Organization.[78] Though Saitama offered to help Genos fight G4, Genos declined in the hopes of making it to the top 10 of S-Class, so Saitama leaves the matter to Genos.[79]

While King struggles to choose a name in a video game, Saitama enters King's residence. At first, King didn't notice Saitama at all, responding to him casually when Saitama recommends him a name. Once King finally notices Saitama, Saitama states that the window was open, despite it being on the 22nd floor.

Saitama questions King.
Saitama questions King.
Eventually, King remembered Saitama from the S-Class meeting and quickly changes the video game to an action game, claiming he got the wrong game by mistake.[80] As Genos was fighting G4, King just played video games. However, Saitama suddenly starts questioning King's escape from the fight against the robot. As Saitama is going to exit, a giant bird-like monster appears, flying directly towards King's room.

Because of his appearance at the scenes, people began to treat him as the hero, giving him the hero name "King". As King was driven to the point where he teared up, silence entered the room, making him think the monster ate Saitama. However, Saitama begins to notice that all the rumors about King were mere lies, but that didn't make him angry. King concludes that Saitama beat the monster, and also learns that it was Saitama who saved him countless times, albeit Saitama still had hair at the time.[83] King begins to apologize to Saitama and confesses that he stole the glory from Saitama's accomplishments.

Fubuki, along with Eyelashes and Mountain Ape, goes to Saitama's place to convince him into joining their hero group. However, Saitama's casual refusal urges them to take him down, but backfires, as Saitama easily knocks out both Eyelashes and Mountain Ape.[85] She expresses her will to secure her position as the rank 1 in B-Class and attacks Saitama with a psychic barrage, but Saitama is unaffected by her ability. Saitama withstands all of her attacks and even patronizes her about being a hero. She asserts her will and continues to attack, this time with a box cutter, but is interrupted by the impact of Genos' attack on Speed-o'-Sound Sonic. Saitama quickly gets between Fubuki and Genos' attack.[86]

Wondering about Genos' presence, she is more surprised that the S-Class hero actually called himself the disciple of the B-Class Saitama. Genos recognizes her but misinterprets her position as being a failed attempt at taking down Saitama, when in actuality she was caught in his attack. Sonic then proceeds to attack Genos with exploding shurikens, but they do no damage.[87] The two are on equal footing and eventually, Saitama attempts to stop them.[88]

Saitama and Sonic battle, and after seeing Saitama defeating Sonic, Fubuki finds out that Saitama is too strong, which is far from the norm for his actual ranking.[89] It is revealed that she has an inferiority complex due to her sister's own power. Due to this, she founded the Blizzard Group to surpass her sister, who is a lone wolf. When Genos asks why Fubuki does not aim for A-class Rank 1, she reveals that she can advance to A-Class, but can never reach Rank 1, because even the Disciples of Atomic Samurai cannot be promoted to S-class due to the hero securing A-class Rank 1: Sweet Mask.[90]

In a final attempt to persuade Saitama into joining her faction, Fubuki belittles Saitama, saying he won't advance alone and that there are several other heroes out there that far stronger than he is. However, when King appears demanding Saitama return the video game he borrowed, Fubuki decides to follow him and be a part of his group, noting that the strong are attracted to Saitama, who does not discriminate on strength.[91] Saitama is shortly after given the hero moniker "Caped Baldy" by the Hero Association.[92]

He first visits Mumen Rider and Tanktop Master, where he asks to know who exactly Garou is.[94] Now knowing that Garou is a strong villain, he wishes to meet and battle him someday in person. After that, Saitama visits Charanko to learn more about martial arts, and who he could fight to learn more about them. Charanko offers him a ticket to observe martial arts at the tournament called the Super Fight that he was originally supposed to participate in, but couldn't due to his injuries. Saitama accepts the offer. However, Charanko advises him not to do something like disguising himself to cover his identity in the tournament. Enticed by the 3 million yen prize for first place, Saitama intends to achieve exactly that.[95]

After Saitama finds a wig shop, he is sneak attacked by Garou, who happens to be there. Garou, thinking that Saitama is after him, tries to hit him with a swift karate chop to the shoulder. However, Saitama is not only unaffected, but also fails to recognize his attacker. Thinking Garou is a robber, Saitama counters Garou's attack by using a karate chop of his own, which knocks out Garou almost instantly, and then carries on shopping for a wig for his disguise.[96] On the following day, Saitama prepares himself for the tournament by putting on the wig. Genos sees what Saitama is doing and, believing that Saitama is trying to make up for his lack of hair, decides to help his master by calling Dr. Kuseno, asking him for a hair transplant for Saitama. After getting the doctor to agree, he asks Saitama if he is free that day, at which point Saitama is finally able to explain that it is a disguise for the tournament, used to make himself look like Charanko. Saitama then tells Genos he will go try to learn what martial arts are really about.[97]

Saitama is pitted against Choze in the semi-finals and defeats him, proceeding to the finals of the Super Fight,[107] where he faces Suiryu. During the fight, Suiryu uses a strong kick that has enough force to knock off Saitama's wig. During the fight both express the struggle to find strong enough opponents, to which Saitama agrees and asks Suiryu to give him the true experience of martial arts, since he's starting to get tired of ending his fights with one punch. Suiryu agrees and asks for the same.[108]

As their fight continues, Saitama manages to block some of Suiryu's kicks, until he is struck into the air and kicked back down, with Suiryu landing on his face. Saitama comes out unscathed, but struggles to keep his wig on while blocking and dodging. Saitama is then dared to punch back, but instead backs away. When Suiryu asks Saitama about his routine, Saitama accidentally lets it slip he beats monsters and tries to mend it by saying he wants to join the Hero Association, but is blown off by Suiryu.[109] After listening to Suiryu's philosophy, Saitama's wig comes off when Suiryu kicks his head. Saitama replies back, telling Suiryu not to get any stronger if he wants to keep having fun, before throwing a punch, stopping before Suiryu's face.[110]

Suiryu uses multiple barrages of many different attacks, but Saitama is completely unfazed. After tanking Suiryu's Void Sky Dragon Fist, Saitama concludes that martial arts are just about moving in a cool way. Saitama then tries to mimic Suiryu's moves, and accidentally launches Suiryu out of the ring into the crowd. However, Suiryu is still chosen as the winner of the tournament, due to Saitama breaking the rules. The referees then try to catch the running Saitama.[111]

Saitama later returns to the arena after hearing Suiryu's voice calling for help. Saitama saves Sneck from Bakuzan, and commends Suiryu for holding his own against the monsters. He then proceeds to confront Bakuzan, telling Suiryu to leave the rest to him.[112]

Saitama immediately leaves in search of other monsters but is unable to find them. He finds out from the C-Class hero Water Gun that the monsters were attacking for 3-4 hours before retreating simultaneously. Saitama feels bad for being oblivious to such an emergency and reflects on himself and questions the Monster Association's actions. Recalling today's events, Saitama wonders if his boredom is the cause of him forgetting something very important. He feels disappointed that he didn't get to face Garou.
