Saitama is the titular One-Punch Man and the strongest character in the series. So far, no enemy has been able to injure him in any way, and almost no enemy has been able to survive a single earnest punch from him. A few enemies have survived punches from him, such as any human he has struck (whom he restrains himself against) and Boros, whom Saitama empathized with and held back against so as to give himself and Boros a satisfying and stimulating fight. His strength is so great that it vastly eclipses even artificial beings designed or bred specifically for superhuman combat, such as mechanical beings or the mutated warriors from the House of Evolution. Since no enemies have posed any real challenge to Saitama yet, the upper bound of his strength is likely even higher than it currently appears. The only opponent (so far) who has actually made him put visible effort into defeating was Garou, whose powers and abilities were enhanced by "God", primarily because the former could replicate Saitama's strength. While his power is only limited to heightened human traits (he cannot fly or fire energy blasts), his superhuman abilities are more than enough to compensate for the lack of variety in his powers.

The origins of Saitama's immense strength remain a mystery. He claims to have gained his extraordinary power through mere physical training, but no one believes him.[65] According to Saitama, after a year and a half of 100 daily push-ups, sit-ups, and squats, plus 10 km daily running, he had achieved some level of superhuman strength.[65] This training was apparently so intense for Saitama that he at times felt he might die, and he attributes his complete hair loss to it.[65] Genos suspects that Saitama himself may not fully comprehend how he acquired his power and hopes to uncover the secret through sparring and observation,[66] while Dr. Genus theorizes that Saitama's intense regimen has allowed him to remove his limiter.[67] It should be noted that Saitama completed all parts of his training consecutively without breaks, all while battling monsters, making the regimen even more demanding than usual.

Despite his unbelievable physical prowess, Saitama can be outperformed by people with skills in areas outside fighting, like when he was bested by Bang in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors or defeated by King in video games, mostly in one-sided matches.[68][69] Furthermore, he also seems to possess a normal human appetite, as he lost to Genos in a spicy noodle eating contest.[70]

Physical Abilities

Saitama displays overwhelming strength in his punches.
Unparalleled Strength: Saitama possesses overwhelming physical strength, capable of effortlessly defeating powerful monsters and villains with a single, casual punch. His punches are so powerful that many monsters simply explode when struck. For instance, during one encounter, Saitama launched himself from the top of a building, punched through a giant meteor, landed safely, and calmly decided to go home.[71] In another instance, when Sonic attempted to attack him with a sword, Saitama caught it with his teeth, effortlessly shattering the blade with the strength of his jaw.[72] When sent from Earth to the moon by Boros, he used his jumping prowess to return to Earth in mere moments, causing a massive shockwave and leaving a large crater on the moon upon departure.[73] A "normal" punch from him was shown to be highly destructive, even to someone as durable as Boros.[74] A Serious Punch from him was able to counter the alien's strongest attack, Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, an attack capable of destroying the Earth's surface (the entire planet in the anime). Not only did Saitama completely neutralize Boros' final attack with the punch, but the resulting shockwave was powerful enough to part clouds on a global scale.[75] In his battle against Orochi, the high-speed pressure of the lava fired from his hands overpowered and completely dispersed Orochi's Gaia Cannon, an incredibly powerful attack that drew energy from the Earth's core and caused worldwide earthquakes.[76] Additionally, he is capable of destroying the Earth if he wanted to,[77] and has threatened to do so when irritated.[78]

Using one hand, Saitama was able to lift the entire surface of Io, a moon of Jupiter, launching its debris into space.[79] During his fight against Cosmic Fear Mode Garou, whose copying abilities allowed him to harness Saitama's striking power, a collision of two Serious Punches produced a Serious Punch², resulting in immensely powerful energy waves capable of destroying the Earth. After being redirected by Blast and his interdimensional allies, the compressed energy from the collision traveled into outer space before exploding and presumably destroying numerous star systems in the far distance, leaving a vast area of starless darkness in the cosmos.[80] In the climax of the battle against Garou on Io, Saitama accidentally blew away half of Jupiter's gas with a Serious Sneeze.[81]

Superhuman Leap: Although Saitama cannot fly, his extraordinary leg strength enables him to leap to incredible heights and distances at high speeds. This is evident when he broke through the ceiling of a tall gymnasium during the hero tryouts simply by jumping.[82] He also smashed a building down to its foundation just by jumping off its roof to punch a massive incoming meteor.[83] His most remarkable feat was leaping from the surface of the moon and landing precisely on Boros' ship on Earth, leaving a big crater on the moon in the process.[84]
Shockwave Generation: In a practice bout with Genos, Saitama demonstrated his ability to control and direct his power, generating a massive shockwave from his punches. He halted his punch just before striking Genos, leading to the shockwave obliterating an entire cliffside behind the cyborg. Additionally, a Serious Punch he delivered against Boros released shockwaves powerful enough to part clouds on a global scale.[85]

Unparalleled Speed and Reflexes: Saitama possesses unmatched speed and reflexes. He completed a 1500-meter dash in the blink of an eye during his hero tryouts.[86] He can effortlessly outpace Speed-o'-Sound Sonic, a ninja known for his superspeed.[87][88] Even Genos's computerized targeting systems have difficulty tracking him.[89] In a humorous display of his speed, he once ran down a building to save a piece of salmon from his lunch and leaped back up without bystanders noticing.[52] His speed is so remarkable that he can easily outmaneuver Flashy Flash, an S-Class hero known for his extraordinary speed, dodging and catching his sword swings with ease.[90] After being kicked to the moon by Boros, he quickly jumped back to Earth, showcasing his ability to travel at high speeds.[91] In addition, he was capable of easily reacting to and blocking rocks thrown at near-light speed by Geryuganshoop,[92] the speed of which being like a bad joke to him.[93]

In his fight against the evolved monster Garou, Saitama proved himself firmly superior to and able to effortlessly keep up with him, despite the Hero Hunter previously being capable of creating a giant light structure alongside Platinum Sperm in only 1.3 milliseconds (0.0013 seconds) through sheer speed.[94][95][96] On Io, one of Jupiter's moons, after performing his Serious Table Flip, Saitama dashed across tons of debris so quickly that he created a large constellation from his sheer speed.[97] Ironically, despite his incomparable reflexes and speed, he still has problems squashing a simple mosquito.[98]

During a training day when he still had hair, Saitama attempted to quickly turn his head to see the back of it in a mirror. Although he failed several times at first, in the end, he supposedly managed to catch a glimpse.[99] This likely required him to move his head at speeds approaching that of light, along with having reflexes and reaction times so quick that the reflected image in the mirror wouldn't have enough time to change significantly before he could perceive it.

Afterimage Creation: Saitama's speed allows him to create afterimages of himself. He first used this during his training bout with Genos.[100] He was also able to create countless afterimages via his Serious Side Hops during his fight with Speed-o'-Sound Sonic.[101]
Superhuman Dexterity and Agility: Saitama is capable of moving any of his limbs at extremely fast speeds without flinching, not stopping until his target is completely obliterated. This is seen when he flawlessly whacks all moles on a Whack-A-Mole machine during the Hero Association exam.[102] He has been shown to be perfect at dodging and performing highly acrobatic maneuvers.[103] His reflexes render him flexible enough to move through the narrowest creeks and dodge attacks at the closest proximity.[104][105] When bombarded by multiple giant bullets from Boros's ship, despite being in mid-air, Saitama could evade all the projectiles before kicking one of them back to the ship itself.[106]
Water Running: Saitama is capable of running across the ocean high-speed without going into the surface of water.[107]
Superhuman Stamina and Endurance: After becoming too powerful from his training regimen, Saitama has no longer been shown to tire out when fighting enemies, although this is expected since he does not push himself to defeat most opponents. The only time he was shown to be panting and out of breath from continuous running, he recovered just seconds later.[108] He could still suppress pain even before gaining his overwhelming power.[109][110] This has been shown on numerous occasions dating back to his days as a middle school student, taking a beating from two upper-level students and, later Piggy Bancon, a Wolf-level threat. Saitama then got back up when the bullies could not and chased after the pig-like monster for his money.[111] Other similar feats include enduring strikes from Crablante and Personification Of A Light Pull Cord during his training as an adult among others. After numerous exchanges of blows with Garou on Jupiter's moon Io, where he repeatedly raced across the shattered surface of the celestial body, Saitama showed little to no fatigue in the aftermath of the fight.[112]

Superhuman Eyesight: Saitama's eyesight is superhuman; after being kicked to the Moon by Boros, he could see, pinpoint the location of the giant spaceship, and land back on it from lunar distance.[91] His tracking capability is also astonishing, as he can concentrate on a fast-moving object for a long time and still not lose sight of it, as seen when he was the only person to see where Garou escaped to.[113][114] In the webcomic, he also showed excellent night vision by spotting Tareo from a great distance in the dark, prompting Garou to remark on his enhanced eyesight.[115]

Supernatural Accuracy: Saitama demonstrates exceptional precision. He had no trouble landing directly on Boros's ship from the moon, despite the extremely narrow angle needed to return to Earth, which permitted minimal margin for error.

Invulnerability: Saitama possesses incomparable physical toughness and durability, capable of withstanding attacks from even the most powerful Mysterious Beings without the slightest damage.[116] In fact, no character has actually been able to damage, or even physically harm Saitama in any way. When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to kill Mosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remained standing right next to him completely unharmed (though his clothes were burnt).[117] Another demonstration of his durability is seen in his fight with Garou, who, despite gaining immense strength from monsterization, couldn't inflict even the slightest injury on Saitama.[94][95] Notably, he withstood Garou's Extreme Fa Jin, a powerful attack capable of raising a vast landmass on the opposite side of the planet, without any harm.[96] When battling a Garou influenced by "God", Saitama took multiple point-blank nuclear explosions from the Hero Hunter and remained unharmed.[118] He also withstood Garou's Gamma Ray Burst head-on, narratively described as the same phenomenon as a gamma ray burst, the most powerful type of explosion known in the universe, and emerged unscathed.[119] Despite Garou using Mode: Saitama, a supernatural mimicry ability incorporating Saitama's striking power, Saitama still withstood the assault without noticeable damage.[112]

Saitama prefers to dodge or block attacks using edged weapons,[120][121] rather than take them head-on, as he sometimes does with strikes from fists or blunt objects. However, it is evident that his durability extends to sharp-edged attacks as well. Nyan's claws, which can cut buildings into pieces, were unable to pierce Saitama's head.[122] Likewise, Garou's Whirlwind Iron Cutting Fist could only shred Saitama's clothing without leaving a scratch on his skin.[123] When being shot by machine guns from Bofoi's advanced robots, the bullets bounced harmlessly off his skin.

Internal Durability: Saitama's flesh and muscles are not only incredibly tough, but his vital organs also exhibit exceptional durability and resistance to damage. This was evident during his fight against Garou, where Garou attempted to destroy Saitama's internal organs with a powerful martial arts technique, yet Saitama emerged completely unscathed.

Extreme Temperature Resistance: Saitama is extremely resistant to temperature-based attacks. When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to incinerate Mosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remained standing next to the cyborg unperturbed and completely unharmed (although his clothes were burnt to a crisp).[124] Despite being fully frozen by Withered Sprout's cryokinesis, he effortlessly shattered the ice and liberated himself, completely unfazed.[125] He has demonstrated the ability to endure Io's frigid surface temperature, which averages around minus 130 degrees Celsius,[126] for at least a short duration.[112] However, it's worth mentioning that when exposed to the surface of Io, with Saitama being completely naked, he experienced a cooling sensation that caused him to "sneeze." Additionally, Saitama is capable of submerging himself in lava with no trouble, viewing it as a nice hot tub.[76] Even Boros, with his power to emit intensely hot energy capable of melting sections of a massive spaceship, failed to faze Saitama.[91] Saitama can also withstand multiple point-blank nuclear explosions and endure their intense heat without even flinching.[118] This ability can be attributed to him refusing to use either the air conditioner or heater during his training.
Radiation Resistance: Saitama demonstrates an abnormally strong resistance to radiation. This was evident when he was kicked to the moon by Boros and remained unaffected by the heightened radiation levels in space. Additionally, when confronted with several nuclear explosions caused by Garou, he was able to meet them head-on and absorb the substantial amounts of radiation released in the resulting mushroom clouds without harm.[127] Despite Garou's radioactive presence being lethal to those nearby and posing a serious threat to life on Earth, Saitama remained unscathed in close proximity.[119] Furthermore, after being directly hit by Garou's Gamma Ray Burst, a powerful energy blast described to be the same phenomenon as a gamma ray burst, Saitama emerged unscathed from the high level of radiation contained in the beam.[118][119]
Psychic Resistance: Saitama is resistant to psychic power. In his scuffle with Tatsumaki, he is able to easily resist her attempt to throw him into space. It is noteworthy to know that Saitama's muscles merely "twitched" when Tatsumaki used her psychic powers on him and that she was not able to keep him up in the air for more than a few seconds because he was "too heavy".[128] This demonstrates that Saitama is not completely immune to the effects of psychokinesis. In the original webcomic, Fubuki noted that Saitama's resistance to psychic power comes from his astonishing willpower,[128] although this hasn't been mentioned in the manga.

Vacuum Adaptation: Saitama has remarkable control over his breath, demonstrated by his ability to effortlessly hold it even in outer space. He managed to jump from the Moon back to Earth in seconds without showing any signs of suffocation.[129] He has been shown to adapt to and withstand extraterrestrial environments where oxygen is scarce or absent. For instance, during his battle with Garou on Io, one of Jupiter's moons, he showed no adverse effects from the thin and unbreathable atmosphere there.[130] These feats, along with his exceptional resistance to radiation and superhuman endurance, suggest that Saitama is capable of enduring the harsh environmental conditions of outer space as well, at least for a decent period of time.

Accelerated Development: After almost a year of following his training regimen, Saitama realized that his body had adapted to move with the prowess befitting a true hero that he imagined.[110] As a consequence, his power started to skyrocket at a rapid pace. In a short period, he achieved unparalleled levels of physical abilities, a testament to his extraordinary growth rate. In his fight with Garou on Io, Saitama's growth rate began to soar exponentially due to the intense emotions coursing through him.[112] Since removing his natural limiter, his potential for growth seems to have no ceiling.

Supernatural Abilities

Non-Physical Interaction: In a case of his strength defying normal logic, Saitama could "knock a hole" in Phoenix Space, a spiritual realm that only exists within Phoenix Man's bird costume, and invade it, much to the latter's confusion.[131] Before entering, Saitama somehow sensed that Child Emperor and Phoenix Man were having a conversation inside this mental space, mistakenly assuming they were talking about his head.

Spatial Interaction: Saitama can physically interact with the fabric of space, demonstrated by his ability to grab and redirect spatial portals created by Garou with his bare hands, which are gateways that connect different points in space.[132] He could even kick away a portal in order to avoid being forcibly transported elsewhere, much to Garou's dismay.[133]
Mimicry: Saitama possesses the remarkable ability to learn and replicate other techniques just by witnessing them once. Like Garou, he can not only copy techniques but also improve upon them. The sheer extent that this mimicry prowess displays is remarkably exceptional, as he was even able to copy Garou's ability to travel through time.[112]

Time Travel: A technique taught to Saitama by Garou. After observing Garou manipulate particles within his body at the sub-atomic level to behave like anti-particles, Saitama successfully replicated it in order to move through time. After traveling to the past, he managed to prevent the tragic events of the Ominous Future (original timeline) from happening again.[112] Since Saitama does not retain memories of the Ominous Future in the current timeline, he is currently presumed unable to use this time travel technique.
The Fist That Defies God: Saitama has the means to strip "God's" power and influence from its minions. For example, Garou and Empty Void became Mysterious Beings and servants of "God" after receiving its power; when Saitama struck them, they were freed from the entity's influence and reverted to being human. This caused Blast to question what makes Saitama's fists capable of such an effect, leading him to ask for Saitama's help in a future confrontation and eventual battle against "God". Sage Centipede also refers to him as "The Fist That Has Turned Against God" (神に仇なす拳, Kami ni Adanasu-Ken).

Fighting Style

Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Thanks to many fights with monsters and villains during his training, Saitama has gained a fair amount of fighting experience. Due to his immeasurable power and the resulting boredom, he usually does not focus on technique and relies on basic attacks. Unlike martial artists, his fighting style is simple but solid, bolstered by his absolute strength. Garou comments that Saitama is an amateur fighter and has many openings to exploit. However, in his fight against Garou on Io, it becomes evident that he is an exceptionally quick learner, capable of mastering any martial arts techniques after observing them only once. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, he chooses to remain a brawler, favoring simple but powerful punches over martial arts. For him, the simplicity of being a brawler is more appealing than mastering complex techniques, as his raw power and speed are more than sufficient to overwhelm his opponents.

Saitama also uses karate chops,[134] and grappling moves to take down villains he doesn't want to kill, or just to knock out people who pick on him.

Improvisation: Saitama is very proficient with improvised weapons, such as when he killed his first monster by deftly using his tie to grab the monster's eye and tear out his intestines. He is proficient at improvising in general; whenever he can't solve a fight with a punch or directly can't punch his foe, he always comes up with a solution in one way or another and uses unique moves supported by his immeasurable power. Some of these instances are with his Serious Table Flip,[135][136] and his Serious Headbutt.[137]

Normal Series: Saitama's Normal Series consists of techniques in which he puts very little effort into attacking. Even though his attacks are loose in this style, most opponents tend to be finished off easily due to Saitama's tremendous strength and speed.

Normal Punch (普通のパンチ, Futsū no Panchi): Saitama punches his opponent. Even though he puts little to no effort into his punch, it is still strong enough to kill almost every opponent, including Dragon-level threats, blowing apart their bodies, crushing their skulls and bones or beheading them. When facing humans, however, Saitama holds back greatly, only using enough strength to knock them out.

Saitama using Consecutive Normal Punches.
Consecutive Normal Punches (連続普通のパンチ, Renzoku Futsū no Panchi): Saitama launches a volley of quick punches from one or both of his hands.[138][139] These blows are powerful enough to blow large body types apart into pieces.[140]
Two-Handed Consecutive Normal Punches (両手・連続普通のパンチ, Ryōte Renzoku Futsū no Panchi): Saitama launches a volley of quick punches from both hands instead of one.[141] While named in the original webcomic, in the manga, Saitama simply refers to it as Consecutive Normal Punches whether he uses one or both hands.[142]
Killer Move: Serious Series (必殺マジシリーズ, Hissatsu Majishirīzu): In Serious Series, Saitama puts more effort into his attacks. His face looks more serious when he performs these "serious" attacks. Despite the incredible strength behind them, Saitama does not actually consider these moves to be anything special.[143]

Serious Punch (マジ殴り, Maji Naguri): Saitama throws an extremely powerful punch. One of his punches was so strong that not only did it completely negate Boros's Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, a beam capable of wiping out an entire planet,[144] but the shockwave from the punch alone was also potent enough to part the clouds on a global scale, as well as deliver the final, fatal blow to Boros. The alien leader also declared that Saitama's finishing blow on him was not even near his true power and that Saitama was still holding back.[145] He also used this move to obliterate Elder Centipede, a Dragon-level threat and one of the biggest monsters in the series.[146] When used against Evil Natural Water, who had become one with the ocean, Saitama was able to dissipate its form and split the ocean entirely.[147] A clash between two Serious Punches, one from Saitama himself and the other from Garou (who gained Saitama's strength thanks to his copy ability), produced a Serious Punch² which released so much destructive energy that it threatened to destroy the Earth. After being diverted by Blast and three of his allies, the energy released from the collision further traveled into space where it presumably destroyed numerous star systems in the far distance,[148] leaving a vast hole of darkness in the cosmos, with the recoil launching both Saitama and Garou to Jupiter's moon Io.Saitama using Omnidirectional Serious Punch.
Saitama using Omnidirectional Serious Punch.
Omnidirectional Serious Punch (全方位マジ殴り, Zenhōi Maji Naguri): Saitama leaps from multiple angles to create a series of afterimages which all then surround and strike the opponent with a Serious Punch, seemingly leaving no room for them to escape. He first used this move against Garou.[149]
Serious Side Hops (マジ反復横とび, Maji Hanpukuyokotobi; Viz: Serious Sideways Jumps): Saitama rapidly hops from side to side, creating a wall of afterimages. He can walk forward while doing so, and the shockwaves caused by it were enough to easily render Speed-o'-Sound Sonic unconscious.[150]
Serious Squirt Gun (マジ水鉄砲, Maji Mizudeppō; Viz: Serious Water Gun): Saitama uses his hands in liquid to squirt a super high-pressured stream. He used this move while submerged in lava to cancel out Orochi's Gaia Cannon which was an extremely powerful attack that drew energy from the very core of the Earth itself.[76]
Saitama performs Serious Table Flip.
Saitama performs Serious Table Flip.
Serious Table Flip (マジちゃぶ台返し, Maji Chabudai-Gaeshi): Saitama digs his fingers into the ground and flips a large amount of ground into the air.[151] He first used this technique against Garou while they were on Io, which completely ripped apart the moon, sending its fragments into outer space.[152] In the original webcomic, this move was first used on Garou in Z-City, which flipped over the Monster Association Headquarters.[153] Because of the magnitude of the effect, Garou experienced profound distortions in his sense of equilibrium.[154][155]
Serious Sneeze (マジ嚔, Maji Kushami): Saitama simply lets out a sneeze. In his fight with Garou on Io, a sneeze struck Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, and blew away half of its gas, exposing the planet's core.[112] This casual and involuntary action ranks among the most extreme area-of-effect attacks shown.
Serious Headbutt (マジ頭突き, Maji Zuzuki): Saitama headbutts his target. In the original webcomic, he used this move to counter a punch from Garou and obliterate his arm.[156]
Warning Expand to see original webcomic information. Beware of spoiler content.
Miscellaneous Abilities

Keen Perception: Saitama has an uncanny ability to see through a person's facade and understand their deepest motivations for acting the way they do. He repeatedly proves this by reading people like Fubuki and Glasses. In a similar vein, he learns of King's deception quickly but opts to keep it to himself. Nonetheless, he excels at it only when he takes it seriously. He is also the first person to recognize Garou's inner turmoil and the fact that the Hero Hunter was always hoping to be a hero and not a monster.[citation needed]

Power Control: Despite possessing overwhelming physical strength, Saitama has shown to have control over it. He can adjust the energy output of his punches and decide how much power to exert. This control allows him to minimize collateral damage to the environment. In spite of being capable of effortlessly obliterating powerful Dragon-level Mysterious Beings,[64] and parting clouds across the entire planet with his punches,[91] Saitama can still deliver strikes with just enough force to incapacitate weaker opponents, such as humans or criminals, without causing fatal harm.[160] In his fight with Garou on Io, an unrestrained sneeze from him scattered half of Jupiter, a planet 318 times Earth's mass. It is likely that if such an involuntary action happened on Earth, he would still somehow restrain it enough to avoid catastrophic damage, since failure to do so would otherwise result in the planet's destruction.

Strong Teeth: In one of his fights with Sonic, the latter attacks him with his sword, which the Caped Baldy replies to via biting and destroying the said sword with little to no effort.[72]

Strong Farts: During his fight with Garou, after getting a stomachache and being sent flying away, Saitama let out an extremely strong fart that the propulsion from the said flatulence gave him enough momentum to soon catch up to the Hero Hunter.[161]

Intimidating Presence: Although he may not look dangerous or intelligent at first glance, those aware of Saitama's power are terrified of him. Sonic and Genos were both shaken by Saitama's ability to seemingly emit a "powerful aura," which made his opponents tremble and feel under pressure.[162][163] In one instance, Carnage Kabuto instinctively sensed this and realized that attacking would mean death, causing him to break out in a sweat and retreat in fear.[164] Phoenix Man and Orochi also experienced the overwhelming pressure of his presence during their encounters with him.[165][166]

Indomitable Will: Saitama has been shown to possess incredible willpower. It is most evident in the flashback to his hero training regime. Even if he was in great pain, or could barely move, or vomited blood, he continued his training.[167] Through sheer willpower and effort, Saitama removed his natural limiter and became an invincible hero. In the original webcomic, Saitama's willpower is also evident in his fight with Tatsumaki. His strength of will is directly connected to his psychic resistance. Tatsumaki, the strongest known esper in the universe, was unable to bend Saitama or lift him into space, exclaiming for the latter that he was "too heavy", although this was while she was injured.[128]

Surfing Skills: Saitama has displayed the ability to balance an entire aircraft carrier and keep it stable as he surfs it down a gargantuan wave.[168]
