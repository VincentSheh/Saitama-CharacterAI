Genos

Saitama saves Genos.
Saitama met Genos after the latter was defeated by Mosquito Girl and tried to self-destruct, saving him before he could do so.[1] Afterwards, Genos asked Saitama to take him on as a disciple, to which Saitama nonchalantly accepts, thinking that Genos was not being serious. Though Saitama was initially annoyed by the thought of having an apprentice, he gradually warmed up to Genos, even becoming slightly worried and concerned when he saw Genos' limp body after he was defeated by the Deep Sea King and after he got smashed into a rock by Tatsumaki.[2][3] Saitama holds some respect for Genos since he became an S-Class hero right off the bat, and desires to move up the ranks due to his S-Class status.[4][5] Genos has become Saitama's companion and the closest thing he has to a best friend. He is also the person who he spends most of his time with, since Genos moved into Saitama's apartment to live with him. Although Saitama has yet to officially call him his disciple (as Genos is always the one identifying himself as his disciple), Saitama actually tries to train him, but since Saitama only knows strength training (which wouldn't help Genos, due to him being a cyborg), most of Saitama's advice/lessons are made up, and only an excuse to keep the cyborg occupied.[6] Despite this, however, Saitama does manage to give Genos some relatively good advice from time to time. Saitama also seems to have enough confidence in Genos to handle certain threats alone, as seen when he accepted Genos' request to fight G4 alone without any pressure (although he asked him if he needs help) and would only help/save Genos, when he sees him in need.[7]

Saitama telling Genos that he has become stronger.
During the Monster Association raid, when Saitama makes it back to the surface, Saitama immediately rushes towards Genos and completely ignores Garou. He asks the damaged Genos if he was okay and who was the monster who broke him so badly. Despite Genos having been torn apart, Saitama still tells his disciple he did a good job, and when Genos questions whether he has gotten any stronger, Saitama places his hand over the cyborg's core and tells him that his heart has grown stronger. This causes Genos to genuinely smile as he expresses his appreciation towards Saitama and Dr. Kuseno for helping him grow so strong.[8]

Saitama exhibits a somber demeanor following Genos' death in the Ominous Future
In the Ominous Future, after Genos is killed by Garou, Saitama arrives at the scene, only to see his lifeless body. When Garou throws the cyborg's core at Saitama, he catches it. As he stares at the depleted core, Saitama recalls how Genos once told him that he always arrives on time but Saitama denied this, stating that he tends to arrive too late. Faced with the grief and anger from the death of his disciple, Saitama finally takes Garou on seriously. The demise of Genos also deeply saddens Saitama to the point of losing any potential excitement at fighting Garou, despite Saitama himself considering the Hero Hunter to be a strong opponent that he's always wanted to face, showing his sadness towards Genos' end. Throughout their entire fight on Io, Saitama used only one hand to battle Garou while tightly holding on to Genos' core with the other, treasuring it as a memento of his disciple.[9]

Bang

Saitama and Bang playing rock, paper, scissors.
Saitama first met Bang when the giant meteor was falling towards Z-City.[10] Bang was amazed by Saitama's strength and wanted to keep a close eye on Saitama. He then started to spy on Saitama, and was greatly surprised to find out that he was actually Genos' teacher. He then started to think that Saitama himself must have an incredible teacher too, but when he asked Saitama about it, he was again surprised to hear that Saitama doesn't have a teacher and destroyed the meteor with his strength alone instead of using a technique. Bang, realizing Saitama's potential, had since then tried numerous times to recruit him into his dojo, albeit unsuccessfully.[11] Bang also showed great displeasure when Tanktop Tiger and Tanktop Black Hole were trying to drag Saitama into their "newbie crushing," but didn't interfere, since he had faith in him and even declared him to be the strongest person he has ever met, showing a great amount of respect for the (then) C-Class hero.[12] Saitama, while not seeing Bang as a friend and showing disinterest in his martial arts, was still slightly impressed by Bang's abilities from time to time, with the best examples being when Bang defeated him in rock, paper, scissors, and later again when Bang told him how he kicked out Garou after his rampage in Bang's dojo, even admitting that Bang must be "kinda strong."[11][13] Saitama seems to have some faith in Bang, as he called Bang to assist him in a competition against Fubuki and her Blizzard Group.[14] After receiving his hero name "Caped Baldy," Saitama shows extreme displeasure towards it and even compared his hero name to Bang's, expressing jealousy of how cool Bang's hero name "Silver Fang" sounded.[15] Saitama and Bang occasionally invite each other to cookouts.[16]

King

Saitama and King walking together.
Saitama first met King when he saved him from Octopus Claw Man during his first one-and-a-half-year of training. While Saitama seemingly forgot about their meeting, King never did, and was wondering for a long time who his mysterious savior was. Saitama would unknowingly continue to save King from various monsters, thus prompting King to unintentionally take the credit for killing at least five Mysterious Beings that were actually killed by Saitama. This caused King to gain fame and "fortune" as an S-Class hero, as well as the reputation as the "strongest man on Earth".

At their second meeting, after saving him from Giant Crow, Saitama discovered King's true personality and the secret to his success. King, realizing that it was Saitama who was saving him all this time, expressed guilt for taking credit for Saitama's actions, though Saitama was not upset or angry at King's secret, much to King's surprise and they even started some sort of friendship. Saitama sometimes goes to King's house to play video games, and regularly gets frustrated at losing to him. Alongside Mumen Rider and Genos, King is probably one of the few people whom Saitama considers a genuine friend. When Garou tried to attack King, Saitama stopped the Hero Hunter with a single kick, saving King again.

King and Saitama also worked together to defeat Elder Centipede, with King luring it towards Saitama so that he could destroy the monster. History would repeat itself and King received credit for killing Elder Centipede.

As well as getting credit for most of Saitama's achievements, King was also accidentally given credit for creating the crater on that moon that Saitama created during his fight with Boros.[17]

Fubuki

Saitama visited by Fubuki who tries to recruit him.
When they first met, Fubuki was trying to force him into joining her group, as she was worried about her rank.[18] After witnessing how powerful Saitama was when she fought him outside his apartment and how he fended off Speed-o'-Sound Sonic and learning that he had friends in S-Class, she started to admire him and decided to join his group.[19][20][21]

She is sometimes seen alongside Genos and King, hanging out in Saitama’s abode. She is apparently obsessed with making Saitama join the Blizzard Group, with her latest attempt being to beat Saitama in a video game competition, which failed due to King’s assistance.[14] Despite knowing that Saitama was superior to her in terms of power, she still doubted that he could actually surpass Sweet Mask and her sister.[21] Fubuki also often becomes irritated by his behavior. For example, when he wasn't listening to her deal and later ditched her with the restaurant bill to chase after Garou, which greatly angered her.[22] Despite this, however, she still returned the cabbage he left at the restaurant and was ready to forget about their mishap if he apologized to her.[23] Fubuki also shows a softer side of hers towards him now and was also showing a lot of patience with him, something not many people who know him are able to do.

Flashy Flash

Flashy Flash and Saitama had a brief scuffle after running into each other at the Monster Association Headquarters. Flash mistook Saitama for a monster and tried unsuccessfully to attack him multiple times. After clearing the misunderstanding, the two become acquainted with each other and journey through the tunnels of the base together, with Saitama unintentionally impressing Flash with his speed and strength.

Zombieman

When Saitama heard of Zombieman's immortality from Genos, he became interested in the S-Class hero and asked him if the rumors were actually true, although Zombieman looked rather displeased by having Saitama around, due to his rank. When Dr. Genus later warned Zombieman about Saitama's strength, Zombieman refused to believe him, even thinking that the former scientist was making fun of him.

Tatsumaki

Saitama meets Tatsumaki, thinking she is a little girl.
In their first encounter, Tatsumaki didn't think much of Saitama due to his ranking, and would regularly insult him. She feels insulted whenever Saitama ignores her. When he first saw her, Saitama mistook Tatsumaki for a little girl due to her small stature and found her to be annoying.

When Saitama ended up confronting Tatsumaki while visiting Psykos with Fubuki, he was upset by Tatsumaki's calous treatment of her sister Fubuki. After a brief clash he realized Tatsumaki was dangerous enough that he needed to take their fight far away from people. Tastumaki, meanwhile, realized that Saitama wasn't a "small fry" when he shrugged off her attacks.

While he had stated he didn't have a strong connection to Fubuki, he made it clear to Tatsumaki that he was fighting her somewhat on Fubuki's behalf stating he was trying to wear Tatsumaki down enough to make the fight with Fubuki fair. This initially enraged Tatsumaki for thinking Saitama was looking down on her but this changed to shock when Tatsumaki started to see how strong Saitama actually was. Tatsumaki started to enjoy the fight while comparing Saitama to Blast.

At the end Saitama realized that Tatsumaki was overprotective of her sister Fubuki and while she had difficulty showing it, knew that Tatsumaki was trying to protect her sister. Saitama congratulated Tatsumaki on he psychic powers, claiming he couldn't keep her contained at all and that she was strong. He also asked her not to be so hard on the Fubuki group telling Tatsumaki that even he wasn't so powerful to start and no one can tell where the limits of other will lie. Tatsumaki ended up taking his advice to heart and started to soften. It was clear even after Saitama's advice resonated because Tatsumaki continued to act nicer by doing things she normally wouldn't like going on a commercial to advertise the Hero Association at the association's request.

Warning Expand to see original webcomic information. Beware of spoiler content.
In an audiobook, it is revealed that the two actually met in a haunted house at a festival Saitama worked at. Saitama thought Tatsumaki was a lost child, and Tatsumaki called him a balding samurai and thought he was a ghost when her powers didn't work on him.

Mumen Rider

Saitama and Mumen Rider share a mutual respect for one another, and a possible friendship.

Saitama respects and acknowledges Mumen Rider's ability to continuously meet the weekly quotas of the C-Class heroes, something Saitama found to be a difficult job. He also compliments Mumen Rider for putting up a nice fight against Deep Sea King.

Saitama and Mumen Rider eating together.
Mumen Rider is one of the few who know of Saitama's true strength and treats him respectfully as a fellow hero. He sent Saitama a thank-you letter for defeating the Deep Sea King, and offered to treat him to dinner, where he personally thanked Saitama, further showing Mumen Rider's humble and respectful nature.

After Mumen Rider got beat up by Garou, Saitama visited him in the hospital and expressed relief to see that he was still alive. Saitama then gave him a banana and asked him for information about Garou.

In an extra chapter, it is revealed that he and Saitama were once schoolmates, but neither is aware of this fact.

Sneck

Originally, Sneck thought little of Saitama due to his rank, as well as the fact that Saitama almost flunked the hero exam. But after he heard about Saitama breaking the exam's physical records and being swiftly defeated by the rookie, Sneck began to recognize Saitama's abilities. Saitama once unknowingly avenged Sneck when he killed the Deep Sea King and defended his honor when he and the other heroes who were defeated by Deep Sea King were being insulted. Sneck was the only person in the Super Fight tournament who was able to figure out he was not Charanko.

Saitama also saved Sneck from being crushed by Bakuzan.

Sweet Mask

At first, Sweet Mask looked upon Saitama with his typical disinterest in the lower class heroes. When Sweet Mask first heard mention of him after Saitama killed the Deep Sea King, Sweet Mask's opinion relegates the newbie as having the aura of a B-Class hero, based on appearances via video feed alone.

Child Emperor

Saitama thought that Child Emperor was pretty cool in his fight with Phoenix Man, and believes that he is a great hero.[25]

Forte

One of Saitama's new neighbors after he moved to A-City. Originally, Forte thought little of Saitama, seeking to abuse his upper-rank status to pressure him. When Saitama was accidentally insulting his fighting style, he wanted a match with him, only to get hit by a car. After witnessing a seismic event caused by his fighting and later witnessed that the cause of it was Saitama going toe-to-toe with Tatsumaki, Forte realized neither he nor his accomplices could hold a candle to Saitama. He then decided to be accepted by Saitama and to get on his good side, apologizing for his rude behavior earlier and agreeing to take care of Black Sperm and Overgrown Rover for him. Forte also told his accomplices that they wouldn't stand a chance against Saitama, and gave them the advice to work on being accepted by him as well.

Blast

Saitama and Blast first met when Saitama, Flashy Flash, and Manako touched one of the mysterious cubes. Saitama did not seem to remember Blast's name despite hearing it before, and Blast did not seem to know who Saitama was as he acknowledged Flash but not him. Despite this, Blast did not mind Saitama's presence and simply agreed with Saitama's explanation of Manako being there.

Later, when Blast asked Saitama for help in the final battle against "God" and that he would reach out to him again later, Saitama casually replied that he would at least make Blast some tea when that time came.[26]

Rivals
Speed-o'-Sound Sonic

Saitama stops Sonic's attack.
Saitama stops Sonic's attack.
Speed-o'-Sound Sonic views Saitama as his eternal rival and vows to defeat him. Saitama views their one-sided rivalry relationship in a nonchalant manner. He does not mind Sonic's persistence and their continuous 'battles', even going so far as to encourage Sonic to do his best. However, he does grow irritated if Sonic starts to bother him during important activities, or harms others.

According to Genos, Sonic is one of the few people who recognize Saitama's true strength. This recognition is what caused Sonic to stop working and continue training in order to surpass Saitama. This recognition and dedication, as well as declaring Saitama a rival and admitting defeat at his hands, indicates (in his own way) a form of respect that Sonic has for Saitama.

After pretending to be Saitama for one day, he gains a new form of respect for Saitama, and vows to never attack him when he's fighting monsters.

Sonic has a very negative outlook on the Hero Association due to the way they look down on someone as strong as Saitama due to his low ranking and appearance. He even criticized Saitama for joining these "so-called worthless heroes" once.

Boros

While being disgusted by Boros destroying other planets during his search of a worthy opponent and getting annoyed by his life story, Saitama still sympathizes with Boros for not being able to find a worthy enough opponent that could give him a stimulating fight, thus prompting him to hold back during their fight to give them both an equal and satisfying duel. After being kicked to the moon by the alien and returning to the Earth, however, Saitama holds back significantly less than before and attacks Boros with more force, which he only survives thanks to his strong regeneration abilities. Boros is also the first opponent that Saitama used a serious move to defeat. While Boros admits that Saitama is far stronger than him and realizes that he wasn't even nearly using his actual level of power, Saitama has respect for Boros, and deems him to be the strongest opponent he has ever faced up to that point.

Choze

They first met during the Super Fight tournament. During his fight with Saitama, Choze gabs endlessly about his genetically superior view and eventually foolishly lets his guard down, which causes a bored, yawning Saitama to send him flying to silence him. Choze formed a grudge against Saitama for defeating him and doing so while yawning. In his monster form, Choze believed that he could defeat Saitama.

Bakuzan

Bakuzan first met Saitama during the Super Fight, where he soon came to dislike Saitama after getting ignored by him and seeing him struggling to tie his belt. He was puzzled by Saitama's lack of movement and became irate when Saitama did not take on a stance, believing him to be untrained and an insult to fight. When Saitama asks for a demonstration of his strength, Bakuzan complies, detailing exactly how he intends to defeat Saitama, in a brutal fashion. After touching Saitama's head and nearly knocking off his wig, Saitama starts to panic and sends him flying with one punch.

Despite his defeat at Saitama's hands, Bakuzan seemed to have forgotten about him and asked him who he was, when he appeared to save Suiryu and Sneck from him. After recognizing Saitama however, Bakuzan uses all of his moves to kill Saitama, but the hero is unaffected by this. Due to his extreme arrogance, Bakuzan cannot comprehend the fact that Saitama is unfazed from his attacks and deducts that Saitama is paralyzed in fear. In order to finish the fight, he initiates his Hell Dispatch Chop as the final blow, only for Saitama to blow off half of his body, killing him.

Orochi

Saitama facing off Orochi underground.
The two first met in the hideout of the Monster Association. Orochi was alerted by Saitama's punch against Overgrown Rover and immediately went to look for the hero. Similarly to Boros, Orochi too acknowledged Saitama's power at first glance.

Saitama initially does not want to fight Orochi and says he is just acting in self-defense. After witnessing Rover run away from Saitama, Orochi realizes that the ghost of Z-City was actually him all along. Restless but excited for the upcoming fight, Orochi immediately leads Saitama to deep underground, where the Mysterious Shrine is located. After telling him about his desire of being resurrected as a "God", Orochi offers Saitama a fight. The hero, on the other hand, is not interested in the slightest about the duel with Orochi, only submerging himself in lava in a playful manner. This makes Orochi become furious and attack him using his strongest attack, Gaia Cannon. Saitama nonchalantly repels said powerful attack from his opponent with his Serious Squirt Gun, simply squirting lava at Orochi before proceeding to defeat him with a single punch, much to the monster's disbelief.[27]

Saitama is then told by Flashy Flash that a certain "Monster King" lives there and gets excited due to the scary epithet, but he is unaware of his identity and therefore did not realize that it was the same monster he already defeated moments before.[28]

Garou

Saitama encountering Garou.
Saitama encountering Garou.
After hearing about Garou's power from Mumen Rider and Tanktop Master, Saitama became eager to fight the hero hunter, hoping for a challenge. Saitama first encountered Garou while shopping for a wig. He was sneak attacked by Garou, but the attack was ineffective and Saitama, who mistook him for a robber, easily defeated him with a karate chop. Later on, when Garou attacked King, Saitama was also present and disposed of him with a single kick, still not recognizing him. Garou attacks Saitama a third time after dine-and-dashing from the same restaurant as him, hoping to exact revenge, but Saitama swats him away so as to not look like an accomplice of his.

Saitama would of course later meet Garou during the aftermath of Sage Centipede death. Saitama didn't recognize Garou at first, though did feel familiarity while Garou attacked him who in turn remembered Saitama. Despite Garou's attempts at crippling to even potentially killing Saitama, Saitama merely finds Garou interesting while also noting how well Garou is at saving people. Even so, this doesn't stop Saitama from realizing the danger Garou has become upon the latter's transformation under the influence of "God".

Ultimately, Saitama's interest in Garou drops upon the discovery of him killing Genos and outright putting many of other heroes in a near-death state. After witnessing these actions, Saitama decides to fight Garou seriously, going to the point where even after being shunted to Jupiter's moon Io itself, he ignores Garou's words about finding a way to return to Earth and instead only wishes to crush him for his actions first.[29]

Once defeating Garou, Saitama would stop his assault on him in respect for Tareo's wishes. Then as soon as Garou regained his mind fully and asked Saitama for a favor to stop his rampage, he agreed and quickly followed Garou's instructions. As he admitted that Garou's martial arts was cool, Saitama seems to have regained some respect for Garou in the end.[30]

Saitama is later the last hero standing and able to fight Garou once Garou becomes a true monster. Garou displayed hatred toward Saitama during their fight, viewing Saitama as the personification of the collective unfairness of the world. Adding to that, Saitama is a hero, and represented everything that Garou hated and was fighting against. Saitama is responsible for defeating Garou both physically and mentally, as he forced Garou to realize that he wanted to be a hero instead of a villain, and by crushing his image of a real hero by telling him that he is only a hero for fun. In the end, Saitama showed mercy towards Garou, refusing to kill him and letting him go, being the only one capable of seeing where he fled to.

Others
Dr. Genus

After witnessing the destruction of several of his creations, Dr. Genus began to study Saitama. He theorized that at some point during his training, Saitama broke through a natural limiter that humans have, but has paid the price with his hair and his emotions.

It is also shown that Genus holds a great deal of respect for Saitama, due to his efforts to successfully remove his limiter to attain godly power, defining all of Genus' ideology about artificial evolution to create better and stronger beings, as well as his desire for eternal life. Furthermore, he respectfully appreciates the fact that Saitama showed him that human willpower alone is able to lift one to incredible heights.

Suiryu

Saitama and Suiryu at the Super Fight tournament.
Saitama initially respected Suiryu and his abilities, asking him to show him the fullest extent of his martial arts in order to get a better understanding. However, Saitama became slightly enraged when Suiryu said that heroes are useless and it's pointless to rely on them. This caused him to abandon protecting his identity, revealing his wig, and for the hero to sternly say to Suiryu that if he wanted to live a fun life, he shouldn't become any stronger than he already was. With a deathly glare, he unleashed his Death Punch, destroying Suiryu's clothes.

Despite his initial irritation towards Suiryu, this did not stop Saitama from intervening in the fight between Suiryu and Bakuzan. In fact, when he arrived, he actually complimented the martial artist for holding out for as long as he did. When Suiryu asked Saitama if he could become a hero, the bald hero said that even with his horrible injuries, it was still possible, showing him support for his goal. However, Saitama was not willing to accept Suiryu as a disciple, demonstrating his unwillingness to take on another disciple and help Suiryu with his dream because of the hassle it would bring. Despite this, thanks to Saitama, Suiryu regains his spirit and decides to become a hero like him.

Manako

He first met her while lost in the Monster Association's headquarters, taking Manako hostage to show him the way around. He's shown to pull her cheeks when he gets annoyed at her. But he's shown to save her when she's seen in danger. When Blast asks why he is with a monster, Saitama refers Manako as his "tour guide and flash-light" even calling her useful, this shows that he doesn't see her as a prisoner.

After the battle with the Monster Association, Saitama wonders what became of Manako.
