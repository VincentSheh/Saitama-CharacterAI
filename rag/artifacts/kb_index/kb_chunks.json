So far, no enemy has been able to injure him in any way, and almost no enemy has been able to survive a single earnest punch from him. A few enemies have survived punches from him, such as any human he has struck (whom he restrains himself against) and Boros, whom Saitama empathized with and held back against so as to give himself and Boros a satisfying and stimulating fight. His strength is so great that it vastly eclipses even artificial beings designed or bred specifically for superhuman combat, such as mechanical beings or the mutated warriors from the House of Evolution. Since no enemies have posed any real challenge to Saitama yet, the upper bound of his strength is likely even higher than it currently appears. The only opponent (so far) who has actually made him put visible effort into defeating was Garou, whose powers and abilities were enhanced by \"God\", primarily because the former could replicate Saitama's strength. While his power is only limited to heightened human traits (he cannot fly or fire energy blasts), his superhuman abilities are more than enough to compensate for the lack of variety in his powers. The origins of Saitama's immense strength remain a mystery. He claims to have",

The origins of Saitama's immense strength remain a mystery. He claims to have gained his extraordinary power through mere physical training, but no one believes him.[65] According to Saitama, after a year and a half of 100 daily push-ups, sit-ups, and squats, plus 10 km daily running, he had achieved some level of superhuman strength.[65] This training was apparently so intense for Saitama that he at times felt he might die, and he attributes his complete hair loss to it.[65] Genos suspects that Saitama himself may not fully comprehend how he acquired his power and hopes to uncover the secret through sparring and observation,[66] while Dr. Genus theorizes that Saitama's intense regimen has allowed him to remove his limiter.[67] It should be noted that Saitama completed all parts of his training consecutively without breaks, all while battling monsters, making the regimen even more demanding than usual.

Saitama displays overwhelming strength in his punches. Unparalleled Strength: Saitama possesses overwhelming physical strength, capable of effortlessly defeating powerful monsters and villains with a single, casual punch. His punches are so powerful that many monsters simply explode when struck. For instance, during one encounter, Saitama launched himself from the top of a building, punched through a giant meteor, landed safely, and calmly decided to go home.[71] In another instance, when Sonic attempted to attack him with a sword, Saitama caught it with his teeth, effortlessly shattering the blade with the strength of his jaw.[72] When sent from Earth to the moon by Boros, he used his jumping prowess to return to Earth in mere moments, causing a massive shockwave and leaving a large crater on the moon upon departure.[73] A \"normal\" punch from him was shown to be highly destructive, even",

Not only did Saitama completely neutralize Boros' final attack with the punch, but the resulting shockwave was powerful enough to part clouds on a global scale.[75] In his battle against Orochi, the high-speed pressure of the lava fired from his hands overpowered and completely dispersed Orochi's Gaia Cannon, an incredibly powerful attack that drew energy from the Earth's core and caused worldwide earthquakes.[76] Additionally, he is capable of destroying the Earth if he wanted to,[77] and has threatened to do so when irritated.[78] Saitama dispersing Jupiter's gases with a sneeze.

After being redirected by Blast and his interdimensional allies, the compressed energy from the collision traveled into outer space before exploding and presumably destroying numerous star systems in the far distance, leaving a vast area of starless darkness in the cosmos.[80] In the climax of the battle against Garou on Io, Saitama accidentally blew away half of Jupiter's gas with a Serious Sneeze.[81] Saitama jumps off the moon.

He halted his punch just before striking Genos, leading to the shockwave obliterating an entire cliffside behind the cyborg. Additionally, a Serious Punch he delivered against Boros released shockwaves powerful enough to part clouds on a global scale.[85] Saitama dodging Genos's attack. Saitama dodging Genos's attack.

The only time he was shown to be panting and out of breath from continuous running, he recovered just seconds later.[108] He could still suppress pain even before gaining his overwhelming power.[109][110] This has been shown on numerous occasions dating back to his days as a middle school student, taking a beating from two upper-level students and, later Piggy Bancon, a Wolf-level threat.

After numerous exchanges of blows with Garou on Jupiter's moon Io, where he repeatedly raced across the shattered surface of the celestial body, Saitama showed little to no fatigue in the aftermath of the fight.[112] Superhuman Eyesight: Saitama's eyesight is superhuman; after being kicked to the Moon by Boros, he could see, pinpoint the location of the giant spaceship, and land back on it from lunar distance.[91] His tracking capability is also astonishing, as he can concentrate on a fast-moving object for a long time and still not lose sight of it, as seen when he was the only person to see where Garou escaped to.[113][114] In the webcomic, he also showed excellent night vision by spotting Tareo from a great distance in the dark, prompting Garou to remark on his enhanced eyesight.[115] Supernatural Accuracy: Saitama demonstrates exceptional precision.

Invulnerability: Saitama possesses incomparable physical toughness and durability, capable of withstanding attacks from even the most powerful Mysterious Beings without the slightest damage.[116] In fact, no character has actually been able to damage, or even physically harm Saitama in any way. When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to kill Mosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remained standing right next to him completely unharmed (though his clothes were burnt).[117] Another demonstration of his durability is seen in his fight with Garou, who, despite gaining immense strength from monsterization, couldn't inflict even the slightest injury on Saitama.[94][95] Notably, he withstood Garou's Extreme Fa Jin, a powerful attack capable of raising a vast landmass on the opposite side of the planet, without any harm.[96] When battling a Garou influenced by \"God\", Saitama took multiple point-blank nuclear explosions from the Hero Hunter and remained unharmed.[118] He also withstood Garou's Gamma Ray Burst head-on, narratively described as the same phenomenon as a gamma ray burst, the most powerful type of explosion known in the universe, and emerged unscathed.[119] Despite Garou",

However, it is evident that his durability extends to sharp-edged attacks as well. Nyan's claws, which can cut buildings into pieces, were unable to pierce Saitama's head.[122] Likewise, Garou's Whirlwind Iron Cutting Fist could only shred Saitama's clothing without leaving a scratch on his skin.[123] When being shot by machine guns from Bofoi's advanced robots, the bullets bounced harmlessly off his skin. Internal Durability: Saitama's flesh and muscles are not only incredibly tough, but his vital organs also exhibit exceptional durability and resistance to damage. This was evident during his fight against Garou, where Garou attempted to destroy Saitama's internal organs with a powerful martial arts technique, yet Saitama emerged completely unscathed.

Radiation Resistance: Saitama demonstrates an abnormally strong resistance to radiation. This was evident when he was kicked to the moon by Boros and remained unaffected by the heightened radiation levels in space. Additionally, when confronted with several nuclear explosions caused by Garou, he was able to meet them head-on and absorb the substantial amounts of radiation released in the resulting mushroom clouds without harm.[127] Despite Garou's radioactive presence being lethal to those nearby and posing a serious threat to life on Earth, Saitama remained unscathed in close proximity.[119] Furthermore, after being directly hit by Garou's Gamma Ray Burst, a powerful energy blast described to be the same phenomenon as a gamma ray burst, Saitama emerged unscathed from the high level of radiation contained in the beam.[118][119] Psychic Resistance: Saitama is resistant to psychic power.

In a short period, he achieved unparalleled levels of physical abilities, a testament to his extraordinary growth rate. In his fight with Garou on Io, Saitama's growth rate began to soar exponentially due to the intense emotions coursing through him.[112] Since removing his natural limiter, his potential for growth seems to have no ceiling.

The Fist That Defies God: Saitama has the means to strip \"God's\" power and influence from its minions. For example, Garou and Empty Void became Mysterious Beings and servants of \"God\" after receiving its power; when Saitama struck them, they were freed from the entity's influence and reverted to being human. This caused Blast to question what makes Saitama's fists capable of such an effect, leading him to ask for Saitama's help in a future confrontation and eventual battle against \"God\".

However, in his fight against Garou on Io, it becomes evident that he is an exceptionally quick learner, capable of mastering any martial arts techniques after observing them only once. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, he chooses to remain a brawler, favoring simple but powerful punches over martial arts. For him, the simplicity of being a brawler is more appealing than mastering complex techniques, as his raw power and speed are more than sufficient to overwhelm his opponents. Saitama also uses karate chops,[134] and grappling moves to take down villains he doesn't want to kill, or just to knock out people who pick on him.

Child Emperor Saitama thought that Child Emperor was pretty cool in his fight with Phoenix Man, and believes that he is a great hero.[25] Forte One of Saitama's new neighbors after he moved to A-City. Originally, Forte thought little of Saitama, seeking to abuse his upper-rank status to pressure him. When Saitama was accidentally insulting his fighting style, he wanted a match with him, only to get hit by a car. After witnessing a seismic event caused by his fighting and later witnessed that the cause of it was Saitama going toe-to-toe with Tatsumaki, Forte realized neither he nor his accomplices could hold a candle to Saitama. He then decided to be accepted by Saitama and to get on his good side, apologizing for his rude behavior earlier and agreeing to take care of Black Sperm and Overgrown Rover for him. Forte also told his accomplices that they wouldn't stand a chance against Saitama, and gave them the advice to work on being accepted by him as well.

This recognition and dedication, as well as declaring Saitama a rival and admitting defeat at his hands, indicates (in his own way) a form of respect that Sonic has for Saitama. After pretending to be Saitama for one day, he gains a new form of respect for Saitama, and vows to never attack him when he's fighting monsters. Sonic has a very negative outlook on the Hero Association due to the way they look down on someone as strong as Saitama due to his low ranking and appearance. He even criticized Saitama for joining these \"so-called worthless heroes\" once.
